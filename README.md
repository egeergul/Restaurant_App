# This repository is our term project for course CS102

## CS102
CS102 gives you an opportunity to put the basic computer literacy, design and programming skills you learnt in CS101 into practice. The course has two components. 

The first is simply a continuation of CS101 aimed at expanding the range of techniques you have available to solve problems. These new techniques will be presented in formal lectures and, as in CS101, you will be given programming assignments designed to let you practice them. Material in this section includes inheritance and polymorphism, recursion, file input and output, object-oriented software design, graphical user interfaces, event-driven programming, sorting and searching, some basic data structures, and exceptions. 

There will be written exams on these topics. The second component of the course is a semester-long design project. The ultimate goal is to produce a commercial-quality program which is fully documented, bug-free and easy to use. You will work in groups, each group selecting a different project. You will be expected to prepare a number of written reports and to present and demonstrate your project. These documents will include basic requirements, specifications, detailed design and user manuals. Groups will discuss each other's work and offer suggestions and criticisms on it so as to help improve the final product. Projects will be undertaken using Java. Students will be expected to display creativity and an ability to learn independently.
